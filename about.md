Kenneth is a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html" target="_blank">architect astronaut</a>, based out of Toronto, Ontario. Back on earth, he spends his recovery time 
playing foosball, drinking coffee, and browsing hacker news. 

He finished his first degree in Archaeology in 2008 only 
to realize how much he loved computers. He knew he had "no choice" but to head back to school for a second degree in 
Computer Science. He has been helplessly addicted to software and programming ever since. 

While in school he paired up 
with his former archaeology department to produce different works including <a href="http://www.arcticiq.com" target="_blank">ArcticIQ</a>, a web based application geared 
towards the preservation and transmission of Inuit word meaning, and <a href="http://www.fortconger.ca" target="_blank">Fort Conger</a>, a maquette that was successful in 
securing funding through VMC Canada. He also enjoyed plenty of time at <a href="http://www.aquanode.com" target="_blank">Aquanode</a>, a small Calgary based dev shop. 

In 2013, he leaped straight out of university and directly into <a href="https://www.bridezillahq.com" target="_blank">Bridezillahq</a>, a startup geared towards disrupting the wedding 
market. He spent 14th months there as CTO before deciding that the wedding game wasn't his style. He is now on the lookout 
for his next big adventure. You can reach him at <a href="mailto:kenneth@kennethbuck.ca">kenneth@kennethbuck.ca</a> for opportunities and inquiries.
